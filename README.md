Many thanks to  @riester / @Riesters  for his help. He really helped a lot. Without him, I would never have done it.

You can repeat process by edit exe of the game via any hex editor without IDA pro. Just open this list with needed hex positions and then using any hex editor go to this position and change (OC) to (FF).

(not all version will be supported becouse it's hard to edit game binarys via IDA pro).

If you have any problems with this or you want to ask for support other versions that not in the list (Only MBE UWP x64/x86 is supported now) then ask help here: https://github.com/Max-RM/Extend-PistonPushLimit-for-MCBE/issues

Later I will make manual how to modify the game via IDA pro (if there is no hex positions for your version of the game you will use this method via IDA pro).
